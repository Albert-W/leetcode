# An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

# For example, consider array A such that

#  A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
#  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
#  A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
# The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.

# Write a function

# class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any element of array A in which the dominator of A occurs. The function should return âˆ’1 if array A does not have a dominator.

# For example, given array A such that

#  A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
#  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
#  A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
# the function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
